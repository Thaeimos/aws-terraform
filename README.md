## General Information

This is for my own practice and trainning.

The idea is to create a scalable 3 tier web application with a database in the end spawning multiple availability zones in a given region, using ECS as the frontend and application stack.


## Technologies Used

- Terraform - version 1.1.7
- Git       - version 2.37.2


## Features

List the ready features here:

- Infrastructure as code.
- Monorepo.
- Docker utility with all the commands and tools needed.
    - Use user's defined service account if present. Otherwise resort to default service account.
- IAM read-only users. Use this [link to connect](https://incode-test.signin.aws.amazon.com/console) to the account with the credentials provided. The code is in this [separated terraform file](/infra-as-code/environments/test/users.tf).
- ECS with EC2.
    - Dynamic AMI as you can see [here](/infra-as-code/environments/test/main.tf#L133).
    - Template substitution for user-data.sh.
- VPC
    - Name as desired.
    - Dynamic public and private subnets creation based on Availability Zones.
    - Variable that tags the environment.
    - Create log partitions for applications
- Github pipelines to manage applications
    - Deploy on merge
- Documentation

## Room for Improvement
Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

- Generate a VPC (VPC01) with public and private subnets, and the required subnets elements (Route tables, Internet gateways, NAT or instance gateways, etc).

- Provision an application using ECS with EC2 and Fargate with the following elements: public component, private component, database component and all the required elements (security groups, roles, log groups, etc). The components must we interconnected, so for example the public layer must connect to the application layer and the application layer must connect to the database layer. A load balancer with target and auto-scalation groups must be utilized for each layer.
- For the database layer, use an AWS managed service.
- Expose the application to Internet using a load balancer of the type you consider the best for this kind of implementation. No need to assign a domain name or TLS certificates, but explanation of what is required to do it will be necessary.
- Select and add five CloudWatch alarms related to the implementation. We require explanation about the reasons of the selected alarms.
- A diagram with the implementation is required.
- Create directory structure for single region.
- Escalate that to multi region.
- Multi cloud usando m√≥dulos
- Security
- Ec2s con un wrapper de go sobre C
- Logging solution from ground up
- Monitoring solution from ground up
- Big query security by row
- Nginx lua
- Blue/Green deployments - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/create-blue-green.html ?
- Test then prod
- Github pipelines
- Module pinning - Perhaps using https://github.com/philips-software/terraform-aws-ecs/tree/2.2.0 ?
- Generate MFA for read only users.
- Encrypt password for read only users.
- Use spot instances for EC2 ECS.
- Pin the AMI for ECS and provide information.
- SSL
    - Create certificates and attach them
    - Redirect http to https
- Docker proper credentials https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/#credentials-store
- Substitute variables on task definition for AWS workflow
- Lint and security scan on PR on applications
- Use environments in GH https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment
